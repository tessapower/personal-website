### Hey, my name is Tessa.

I'm a developer studying a BSc in Computer Science at Massey University. I'm looking for remote intern opportunities working in C++. We'll get along great if you like dogs and terrible puns!

In a previous life, I worked at tech startups big and small! I worked together with the CTO of [YR](https://thisisyr.com) to transition their development teams (distributed across New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo) to Agile and improve how their teams work remotely across timezones. I'm a Scrum Alliance Certified Product Owner, and have years of experience working remotely and in teams.

I'm certified by the ISTQB as a Foundation level tester, and through experience I have an appreciation for software testing and quality control; at Teleportr I managed the release of 3 iOS apps to the App Store, and worked with developers to introduce scripted release management into our CI/CD pipeline! At [Tātou](https://tatou.app) I inherited a broken and manual collection of tests that I readied to integrate into their CI/CD pipeline, too. I also initiated Tātou's transition from Katalon to Detox for their React Native app, and from Katalon to React Testing Library for their ReactJS Web app.

I speak English and German! I studied Mechatronics for a year while working at [Cenit](https://cenit.com), a German firm that produces the world's leading software for offline robotics programming and optimisation of production line processes.
