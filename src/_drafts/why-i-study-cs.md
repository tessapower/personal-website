title: Why I study CS

### In 2015...

I had set off on a travel adventure, and was staying with a friend in Germany for a few months. During the week, he was a software engineer and on the weekends, my travel guide. Sometimes I'd hang around his office, too. The office wasn't huge—there were around 10 employees—and they were all working on an iOS app, a to-do list.

One day, possibly after distracting everyone with too many questions, my friend suggested I try to follow a [Swift tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/). Using a computer is easy, but I had put anything to do with computer science in the _too-hard-basket_. I accepted his challenge, unaware what I was really getting into. Before that day, I hadn't thought that software development was "in my scope".

With no prior CS experience, I spent a while scratching my head and googling definitions. Following the tutorial wasn't as simple as I initially thought. I had to be creative as well as logical, which seemed counter-intuitive at the time. After a few hours, I had hacked together an app, which I proudly showed everyone. It was just a table view of recipes, and it only ran on my iPhone, but I had made it myself.


I remember that day fondly! In reality, it looked something like this:

It looks grim, but I was enjoying myself, I swear! That was the day the seed was planted...

### In late 2016...

The seed sprouted! I moved to Germany to learn the language, and immerse myself in the culture. I spent 9 months in intensive language courses so that I could get into a German University and study Computer Science.

### In 2017...

I attended the Cooperative State University of Baden-Württemberg. It will come as no surprise that studying a technical field in a foreign language is extremely difficult! I pushed through, despite being wildly under-prepared and out of my depth. After a year of study, (and a few rewritten exams) I left—although my ego was battered, I was still sure that this is the right path for me.

### In 2018...

I joined an early-stage tech startup! I wasn't quite sure what I could do, but I was eager to learn as much as possible. I worked with an few excellent minds, who mentored me and challenged me. Thanks to them, I was able to learn and hone technical skills. But being part of an early-stage startup meant that I got to wear many hats: customer support, junior website hacker, iOS app tester and deployer, coffee-maker, marketer, social media guru, and cycle courier to name a few!

### In 2019...

We worked 14 hour days, spent a lot of time playing ping-pong, saw a few cycling injuries, and even shifted countries! It was a stressful, fun, busy, exciting, and happy time, but after 18 months the company shut down. I moved onto a more mature startup, where I put the lessons I learned into my role as a Product Associate. The role was exciting, and my teammates were great, but it was not where I wanted to be.

### In 2020...

I decided to finish off that Computer Science degree! There were a lot of good options, but the best option for me was was to study through Massey University. MU offer a Comp Sci degree 100% online, so I can choose when and where to study. The choice was simple—New Zealand! It's not only where I'm from, but also a beautiful country. In July 2020, I begin my first semester. Until then, I'll be working on small personal projects to learn c++, and other technical skills.

I wanted somewhere to document my journey, and the result is what you're reading now! In later posts, you'll be able to read about my personal projects and the lessons learnt.
