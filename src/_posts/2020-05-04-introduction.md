I'm a 27 year old from New Zealand. I've lived in a few different countries, seen a few things, and now I'm studying Computer Science at Massey University.
After I finish, I'm going to work in the games industry as a developer.

Things that I will passionately talk your ear off about about are:
* Languages (human and computer);
* Video games (especially Zelda, Pokemon, Final Fantasy IX through X-2 and Kingdom Hearts);
* Exploring the outdoors (and running around in it);
* Rock climbing;
* Scuba Diving; and
* Spicy food.

If you have feedback, know any bad jokes, or know something I should write aboutâ€”just [tweet me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@dearesttessi%20 "Tweet Tessa")!
