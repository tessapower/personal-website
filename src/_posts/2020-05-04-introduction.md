At the time of writing, I'm 27. I'm from New Zealand, but I've lived in a few different countries and learned a few different languages. I only know enough to order an ice cream in Italy and a coffee in France—German is the language I can speak mostly fluently. 

Things that I will passionately talk your ear off about about are:
* Languages (human and computer);
* Video games (especially Zelda, Pokemon, Final Fantasy IX through X-2 and Kingdom Hearts);
* Exploring the outdoors (and running around in it);
* Rock climbing;
* Scuba Diving; and
* Spicy food.


I'm studying a Bachelor of Science at Massey University—my major is Computer Science and my minor is Math. After I finish, my goal is to work in the games industry as a developer.

If you have feedback, know any bad jokes, or know something I should write about—just [tweet me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@dearesttessi%20 "Tweet Tessa")!
