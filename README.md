## Personal Website

This is a repo for my personal website, where I post about what I'm learning and working on.
It's generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for Windows, the [Contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) template from Niklas Buschmann, and automatically deployed via [aws Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).
